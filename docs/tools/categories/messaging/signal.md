## Additional Information
- **Limitations and Vulnerabilities**: Signal operates using centralized servers, which are necessary to manage encrypted communication and ensure secure message delivery. However, for enhanced privacy, Signal does not offer cloud backup options—meaning users must manually transfer data when switching devices. Its strong end-to-end encryption contributes to slightly higher bandwidth usage compared to less secure messaging apps. Additionally, due to its emphasis on privacy and encryption, Signal may be blocked or restricted in certain countries where governments impose tight controls on secure communication tools.
