## Additional Information
- **Limitations and Vulnerabilities**: Currently in beta and not recommended for security-critical activities. No third-party security audits. Some features are broken or buggy: cannot delete messages, rename channels, or consistently leave communities. Mobile support limited to TestFlight beta. Occasional lag and performance issues. File sharing functionality is inconsistent. Tor may be blocked in some regions requiring additional circumvention. Resource intensive with noticeable CPU usage.
- **Additional Notes**: Particularly valuable for civil society organizations in authoritarian environments due to its decentralized nature and use of Tor onion services, which makes it harder to block or surveil. However, the beta status and lack of security audits make it unsuitable for high-risk communications at present.
