## Additional Information
- **Limitations and Vulnerabilities**: Its platform availability may be limiting, with some platforms lacking full feature parity. The option to self-host requires technical expertise, which can be a barrier for non-technical users. Additionally, the app relies on third-party hosting by default, raising privacy concerns for those wanting full control over their data. Notesnook also lacks some advanced features found in other note-taking apps, such as rich multimedia support and integrations with other tools. The user interface may be complex for some, and the free version has limitations, requiring users to upgrade for syncing across devices. Also, if a user forgets their password, all the data is lost by design (can be good or bad). Lastly, while Notesnook has an active community, it is still relatively small, meaning support might be slower or less comprehensive than more mainstream apps.
