## Additional Information
- **Limitations and Vulnerabilities**: VeraCrypt is currently not available for iOS or Android, limiting accessibility for users who rely heavily on mobile devices. Workarounds involve using third-party tools, which may introduce security risks. VeraCrypt does not encrypt individual files; it encrypts whole disks or partitions. Even for small files, users must maintain containers and files must be transferred inside the volume to be secure. Individual files cannot be encrypted in real time until the entire container is mounted. Must mount volume manually for every time it needs to be used (might be less seamless).
