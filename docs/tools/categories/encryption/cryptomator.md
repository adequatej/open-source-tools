## Documentation & Testing
- **Full Documentation**: [Cryptomator Documentation](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20054319/cryptomater.pdf)
- **Version Tested**: 1.15.3
- **Date Tested**: 2025-04-22
- **Testing Environment**: HP Envy x360, 13th Gen Intel(R) i7 processor, 16 GB RAM, Windows 11, Network: 4G

## Additional Information
- **Limitations and Vulnerabilities**: No built-in syncing (relies on third-party cloud sync clients), Paid features for mobile apps (iOS and Android require one-time purchase), Vaults need to be manually created in cloud storage, No built-in circumvention tools, Potential metadata leakage if server traffic is monitored
- **Additional Notes**: Particularly valuable for civil society organizations in authoritarian environments as it encrypts files locally before cloud storage, requires no registration or cloud-based logins, works across diverse platforms, and prevents data interception through local encryption/decryption. Its decentralized nature makes it harder for governments to block or disrupt.
