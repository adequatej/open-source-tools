## Additional Information
- **Limitations and Vulnerabilities**: According to 2024 3rd party audit ‘documentation could be improved to clarify the commitment to user privacy and avoid any potential data leaks’ & ‘A formal code review process ought to be implemented, focusing on privacy implications for all changes. This process should include peer reviews, automated privacy checks, and regular audits to ensure privacy considerations are consistently addressed during development.’
Websites can limit down their search results if they can determine that you have a different screen resolution than other users. For this reason, running Tor in full screen mode is not advised nor is installing any browser extensions.
Although Tor exclusively secures communication within the Tor Browser, many users mistakenly think it encrypts all of their data. Tor does not cover any other apps, like Zoom or Spotify.
Tor helps protect your privacy online, but it can't protect you if your device is already infected — like if someone installed a keylogger or screen recording malware on your computer.
Do not log into personal accounts (Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) or download documents while using Tor as it breaks anonymity.
