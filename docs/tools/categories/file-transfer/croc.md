## Additional Information
- **Limitations and Vulnerabilities**: Address major drawbacks, such as poor usability for non-technical users, etc. Croc is a CLI-only tool and does not work in web browsers(No use through Tor to increase security of file transfer). While Croc supports NAT traversal to some extent, it lacks more advanced or varied options like WebRTC or ICE-based STUN, which can better penetrate firewalls and complex NAT scenarios. Using the public relay server could expose metadata (e.g., IP addresses, timing information) to the relay operator
