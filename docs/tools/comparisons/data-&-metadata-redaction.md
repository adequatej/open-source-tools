| [MAT2](https://github.com/jvoisin/mat2) | MAT2 does not have dedicated security features as it primarily focuses on privacy by removing metadata from files. The tool's purpose is to strip EXIF data, location information, and device details embedded in files to prevent privacy leaks. However, it does not implement encryption, authentication, or other security measures like secure file transfer or data protection. Its privacy focus ensures no user data is collected, and it is open-source, allowing for transparency and community audits. | No Data Collection | GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL-3.0) | ✅ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4.00) |
