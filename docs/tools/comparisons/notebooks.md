| [Notesnook](https://notesnook.com/) | A service with a local client that’s hosted by a third party - You install a client on your device, but it connects to and depends on a remote server. Can also be self-hosted. | Very frequent updates; Updated about once a month on average. Very responsive development team and can be contacted through email, discord, reddit, and twitter for issues or questions. Notesnook is funded solely through its subscription-based Pro plan and small grassroots community donations, with no government backing. It maintains a public ledger of monthly contributions (as low as $1) and total raised funds (~$171 as of April 2025) through its Open Collective Page. The software appears to be well established and financially stable. | 2025-04-21 | ⭐⭐⭐⯪☆ (3.30) |
