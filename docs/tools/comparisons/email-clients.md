It is installed directly onto OS systems, where it manages and syncs emails, contacts, and calendars through IMAP, POP3, and other email protocols. The tool does not require a server for basic functionality but supports integration with external email services for sending and receiving messages (Thunderbird application is a standalone software but email data is located on the remote email server---IMAP or POP3). | It is updated regularly with new monthly releases for users who want all available features and bug fixes monthly. Bug reports and feature requests are handled through [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) and GitHub. Response times vary but important security issues are prioritized quickly. It is primarily funded by the Mozilla Foundation (a non-profit organization). Sustainable through generous donations and small partnerships. Thunderbird is financially sustainable and has long term development plans. | 2025-04-23 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⯪ (4.70) |
