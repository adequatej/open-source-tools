# Tool Assessment Criteria

This document outlines the comprehensive criteria used to evaluate tools in our repository, including both the scoring system and data structure.

## Assessment Overview

Tools are evaluated based on five main categories, each with specific metrics and weights. The evaluation process combines both quantitative scoring and qualitative assessment of key features.

## Scoring Categories & Weights

### 1. Operational Functionality (10%)
- **Functionality** (1-5): Core features and reliability
- **Localization & Language Support** (1-5): Language availability and community translation
- **Mobile Accessibility** (1-5): Mobile app and browser support

### 2. Usability for Non-Technical Users (25%)
- **Installation/Deployment** (1-5): Ease of setup
- **User Onboarding** (1-5): Learning curve and documentation
- **Technical Requirements** (1-5): Required technical knowledge

### 3. Security & Privacy Strength (30%)
- **Encryption Standards** (1-5): Security protocols and algorithms
- **Threat Resilience** (1-5): Resistance to known threats
- **Security Best Practices** (1-5): Compliance with standards
- **Data Minimization** (1-5): Data collection practices
- **Privacy Policy** (1-5): Transparency and compliance

### 4. Maintenance & Sustainability (15%)
- **Active Development** (1-5): Update frequency and responsiveness
- **Community Support** (1-5): User community and documentation
- **Funding & Sponsorship** (1-5): Financial sustainability

### 5. Performance Efficiency (20%)
- **CSO Function** (1-5): Relevance to civil society organizations
- **Effectiveness** (1-5): Performance and reliability
- **Resource Usage** (1-5): System requirements and efficiency

## Data Structure

Each tool is documented with the following structured data:

### Basic Information
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Tool Name | String | Official name of the tool |
| Category | ID | Primary category (e.g., "Secure Communication") |
| Status | Boolean | Active/Inactive status |
| Version | String | Current version number |
| Last Update | Date | Most recent update |

### Technical Requirements
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| OS Compatibility | List | Supported operating systems |
| Installation Manual | Boolean | Availability of installation guide |
| User Documentation | Boolean | Availability of user guide |
| Technical Knowledge | String | Required expertise level |

### Security Features
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Security Features | List | Implemented security measures |
| Encryption Standards | List | Encryption protocols used |
| Data Collection | List | Types of data collected |

### Development Status
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Active Development | Boolean | Current development status |
| Community Support | String | Community activity level |
| License | ID | Software license type |
| External Links | URL | Project website and resources |

## Scoring Calculation

The final score is calculated using the following formula:

```
Final Score = (0.10 × Operational Functionality) +
              (0.25 × Usability) +
              (0.30 × Security) +
              (0.15 × Maintenance) +
              (0.20 × Performance)
```

Each category score is the average of its sub-metrics.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Review all basic information fields
   - Verify technical requirements
   - Check security features

2. **Scoring Process**
   - Evaluate each metric on a scale of 1-5
   - Document specific observations
   - Calculate category scores
   - Compute final weighted score

3. **Documentation**
   - Record all assessment data
   - Include specific examples
   - Note any limitations or concerns
