### Why is this useful to civil societies in authoritarian environments?
Tor Browser is particularly valuable for civil society organizations in authoritarian environments because:
1. It provides strong anonymity and privacy protections
2. It helps bypass internet censorship
3. It protects against surveillance
4. It's free and open source
5. It's regularly updated to counter new censorship techniques
6. It has built-in bridges to help access the Tor network in restricted regions
7. It's available in multiple languages, including East Asian languages
8. It requires minimal technical knowledge to use
9. It's actively maintained and supported by a strong community
10. It has been proven effective in various challenging environments

Note: While Tor Browser is generally available worldwide, some countries actively block access to the Tor network. In such cases, users may need to use bridges or other circumvention tools to access the network.
