For this reason, running Tor in full screen mode is not advised nor is installing any browser extensions.\nAlthough Tor exclusively secures communication within the Tor Browser, many users mistakenly think it encrypts all of their data. Tor does not cover any other apps, like Zoom or Spotify.\nTor helps protect your privacy online, but it can't protect you if your device is already infected \u2014 like if someone installed a keylogger or screen recording malware on your computer.\nDo not log into personal accounts (Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) or download documents while using Tor as it breaks anonymity.",
