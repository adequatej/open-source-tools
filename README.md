### 2. Metrics for Comparability
These five categories contribute to the overall tool assessment score. Each category has sub-metrics with assigned weights, and the category score is calculated as a weighted average of its sub-metrics.

#### **1. Operational Functionality (Weight: 20%)**
| Sub-Metric                      | Weight | Data Type | Example Value |
|---------------------------------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Offline Functionality | 30%    | Integer (1-5) | 3 |
| Localization and Language Support       | 50%    | Integer (1-5) | 5 |
| Mobile Accessibility   | 20%    | Integer (1-5) | 2 |

#### **2. Usability for Non-Technical Users (Weight: 25%)**
| Sub-Metric                      | Weight | Data Type | Example Value |
|---------------------------------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Ease of installation/deployment | 40%    | Integer (1-5) | 3 |
| User onboarding experience      | 35%    | Integer (1-5) | 4 |
| Technical experience required   | 25%    | Integer (1-5) | 2 |

#### **3. Security & Privacy Strength (Weight: 30%)**
| Sub-Metric                      | Weight | Data Type | Example Value |
|---------------------------------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Encryption standards            | 30%    | Integer (1-5) | 5 |
| Resilience against known threats| 25%    | Integer (1-5) | 4 |
| Compliance with security best practices | 20% | Integer (1-5) | 3 |
| Data minimization               | 15%    | Integer (1-5) | 4 |
| Privacy policy transparency     | 10%    | Integer (1-5) | 5 |

#### **4. Maintenance & Sustainability (Weight: 15%)**
| Sub-Metric                      | Weight | Data Type | Example Value |
|---------------------------------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Active development              | 50%    | Integer (1-5) | 5 |
| Community support               | 30%    | Integer (1-5) | 3 |
| Funding & sponsorship           | 20%    | Integer (1-5) | 2 |

#### **5. Performance Efficiency (Weight: 10%)**
| Sub-Metric                      | Weight | Data Type | Example Value |
|---------------------------------|--------|----------|--------------|
| CSO Function          | 50%    | Integer (1-5) | 4 |
| Relevance    | 30%    | Integer (1-5) | 3 |
| Effectiveness | 20% | Integer (1-5) | 2 |

### **Final Scoring Calculation**
Each category is scored as a weighted average of its sub-metrics. The final tool score is then computed as a weighted sum of all five categories:


$$
\text{Final Score} = (0.20 \times \text{Relevance}) + (0.25 \times \text{Usability}) + (0.30 \times \text{Security}) + (0.15 \times \text{Maintenance}) + (0.10 \times \text{Performance})
$$

This system allows users to adjust weights dynamically on a webpage to find tools that match their specific needs.
